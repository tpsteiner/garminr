Update 8/11/2019: I stopped using my garmin watch, and lost personal interest in this project. Two years ago, the script was able to connect to log into your personal Garmin profile, and retrieve the selected data in XML format. I did not get to cleaning the data.

As aids in my research, I have used a python 2.7 script that [downloads all user activities in XML format](https://github.com/magsol/garmin/blob/master/download.py), and the [tapiriik.com](tapiriik.com) python code for [connecting to the Garmin website](https://github.com/cpfair/tapiriik/blob/master/tapiriik/services/GarminConnect/garminconnect.py).
