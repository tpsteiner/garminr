I stopped using my garmin watch, and lost personal interest in this project.

As aids in my research, I have used a python 2.7 script that [downloads all user activities in XML format](https://github.com/magsol/garmin/blob/master/download.py), and the [tapiriik.com](tapiriik.com) python code for [connecting to the Garmin website](https://github.com/cpfair/tapiriik/blob/master/tapiriik/services/GarminConnect/garminconnect.py). Many thanks to the users who made these scripts available. I would have quit without them.
